## Overview and Origin

Founded in 2009, Stripe helps process online payments for small businesses and even tech giants like Microsoft and Zoom. It remains the most valuable fintech in the U.S. with a \\$95 billion valuation, up from $35 billion last year. Stripe is also the second-most valuable startup in the world—eclipsed only by TikTok owner ByteDance.

Focus on financial servises and softeare as a service(SaaS) the company has two main head-quarters in South San Francisco California, United States and in Dublin, Ireland.

Stripe's core business is to offer ***payment processing software*** and APIs for ecommerce and mobile Apps.

Brothers John and Patrick Collison fonded Stripe in Palo Alto, California. In 2011, the company recived invesment from people like Elon Musk and Pether Theil.

At the age of 16 Patrick recived the Young Scientist of the year award. As per John, he scored the highest-ever recevid by a student in the Irish Leaving Certificate. He attended MIT, as per John, he attended Harvard.

They began to work on stripe in 2009, at the time Patrick as working on several side projects and the debates why it was so difficult to  accept payments on the web. They sought to solve the problem and see if it was possible to make it simple.

Within 2 eeks of building the prototype they had their fist transctions with a Y combinator a company called 280 North. Eventually its founder Ross Boucher (their first customer) would join Stripe as one of the first employees.

In the beginning they weren’t sure how big the market was or if they could provide the user experience that they wanted. They also didn’t have the answers to whether or not they could fully address issues like fraud, non-US payments, and solving similar problems that Paypal does but in user-friendly way.

Stripe originally partnered with a payments company but after they started taking it seriously they realized that the only way to control the entire experience the way they wanted to was to control all aspects of the process. They brought everything in house.

After 6-months they determined they were onto something big and that they could create the user experience that they wanted. Both John and Patrick started working on it full-time in the fall of 2010. The company was still bootstrapped, but the founders were starting to realize that as a payment startup they would need institutional credibility that an investor could provide. According to them they “didn’t look great on paper.” (To each his own standards but in my book they qualified as extremely legit. Note first two paragraphs above) John became the President and Patrick the CEO.


## Competitors

Some of the competion are also taking their piece of the cake. Paypal, WePay, Square, Dwolla and even Gumroad. All of which are bringing online payment solutions to segments that are desperate for better solutions in the market.

|Stripe vs Compettitors|
|:---------------------|
|1. Square: Better for in-person transctions|
|2. PayPal: Better for brick-and-mortar businesses expanding online|
|3. Adyen: Better for larger businesses with high transactions volumes|
|4. Verifone (formerly 2Checkout): Better for online-only businesses that sell around the world|
|5. WePay: Better for online software businesses and Chase customers|
|6. Authorize.net: Better if you already have a merchant account or need only a payment gateway|
|7. Braintree: Better for online businesses looking for a straightforward payment gateway with a merchant account|
|8. PayJunction: Better for businesses ready to go paperless|
|9. Stax (formerly Fattmerchant): Better for businesses with high processing volume looking for traditional merchant accounts|


## The Future of Stripe

With more transactions moving online every single year, payments companies continue to be among fintech’s largest and fastest-growing businesses.

Stripe, the largest private fintech in the world, grew its transaction volume in 2021 to $640 billion, up 60% from 2020, across 50 countries.


Its gross revenue, still mostly the 2% to 3% it collects on such volume, reached nearly \\$12 billion in 2021, according to sources with knowledge of its financials, up about 60% year over year. Net revenue, which excludes the cut Stripe passes along to partners like Visa and Chase, reached nearly $2.5 billion. And, unusually for a unicorn that’s still growing fast, Stripe finished the year with hundreds of millions in profit on an Ebitda basis, two sources add. Stripe declined to comment on its figures.

The biggest question about Stripe was when it would finally go public. The ongoing pandemic, a brutal land war in Europe, a global energy crisis (see page 102) and a busted supply chain have largely made such concerns moot. The S&P 500 is off nearly 20% so far in 2022; big tech concerns like Stripe’s public peers have fared even worse. The shockwaves from such instability are being felt by businesses big and small—and Stripe, which powers transactions for everything from delayed Peloton bike orders to hard-to-find baby formula, has a front-row seat.

Stripe’s closest publicly traded peers, such as Adyen, PayPal and Square, are all down more than 40% year to date. The Collisons are in no rush to join this crowd. But if any tech darling could stage a listing in this market, Stripe would be the obvious candidate, says analyst Jordan McKee, of 451 Research.

### Stripe next 10 years

Embedded financial services: products like lending, cards, and financial accounts. It's a move that makes sense for platforms, whose SMB customers are eager to consolidate vendors and are often underserved by traditional banks. 


### New Features 

One of the newest features that Stripe has put out to production. Is the ***embeddable and customizable fiat-to-crypto onramp***. It is very easy to embed in any site fiat-to crypto payment widget.

## Recommendations

I recommend exploring the ***Point of Sales*** business. Developing a plug and play solution, the final user purchases a box and in it has the tablet, mini printer, money drawer, cables and POS solution.

There are some competitors that are already offering this solution so it makes sense that Stripe would offer something similar.
